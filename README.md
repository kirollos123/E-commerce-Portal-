# E-commerce Portal Architecture for African Customers

## Overview
This project involves designing a cloud architecture solution for an e-commerce business targeting African customers. The solution focuses on ensuring:
- Low latency
- High availability
- Fault tolerance
- Secure storage for relational user data and product images
- Cost optimization within a limited budget

---

## Features
- Multi-AZ (Availability Zones) deployment for fault tolerance.
- **Amazon S3** for scalable product image storage.
- **Amazon RDS** for fast and secure relational data storage.
- Traffic distribution using **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**.
- Auto Scaling groups to handle traffic spikes.
- Monitoring and logging with **Amazon CloudWatch** and **AWS CloudTrail**.

---

## Challenges and Solutions
### Challenge 1: Multi-AZ Synchronization
- **Solution:** Used AWS native tools to enable seamless synchronization across Availability Zones.

### Challenge 2: Traffic Management
- **Solution:** Deployed an Elastic Load Balancer and Auto Scaling groups to efficiently manage traffic spikes and ensure consistent performance.

### Challenge 3: Cost Optimization
- **Solution:** Leveraged reserved and spot instances to balance high availability with a constrained budget.
